# Reporting Bugs

## Security
Never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs which include
sensitive information to the bug tracker or other public location. Instead,
sensitive bugs, and any security issue, should be submitted directly to

The Autonomic OSS community takes all security bugs seriously.
Thank you for improving our security. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.
